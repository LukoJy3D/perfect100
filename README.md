# Perfect100

Repo is for those crazy achievement hunters who love going for that 100%. After that grinding completion, there is nothing better than sharing the knowledge with others!
Feel free to contribute, make feature/guide requests, and ask for help with challenging achievements. This repo is and probably will always be a work-in-progress type of thing for me, so I hope we will find more minds alike :]

Find guides under /guides/<name of the game>/achivements/<name of the achievement>

Read guides more conveniently on [Github Pages](https://lukojy3d.github.io/perfect100/)

## Ways to contribute

1. Add game ID to [games.yml](games.yml). Github actions will do the rest of the templating and some silly AI content.
2. Add missing guides where it says `Add guide here`.
3. Post an issue with a request for new guides or improvements on existing ones.
