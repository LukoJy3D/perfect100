_Get full combo on at least 15 different levels on hard difficulty (solo free play only)._

***

To unlock this achievement, you must not miss a single note on 15 different songs on hard difficulty. If you are good at the game, this is a no-brainer. If you are a beginner, it might take some time.

Few tips:
1. Start on easier levels and make sure you can beat them with a full combo before proceeding to harder difficulties.
2. Some songs are easier than others, so choose levels that are less arm-breaking, such as "Legends", "Beat Saber", and the "100$ bills".
3. Play the songs with "No obstacles", "No bombs" and "Slower song" modifiers.
4. If you are having difficulty with stock maps, you can try installing custom ones.

Nasty way (Create your own map):
1. Open the map editor.
2. Make a level or multiple ones with a single note.
3. Play those levels.

But I would strongly discourage using this workaround. Beat saber is a super fun game, and beating levels on the full combo is what makes it challenging and the achievement hunt exciting.
