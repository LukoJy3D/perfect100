_Clear any level on normal difficulty and get at least 50 combo without any modifiers._

***

To unlock this achievement, you must get 50 note combo on any normal difficulty map without modifiers. **Pay Attention** achievement will likely be one of the first achievements in the game, especially if you start with the campaign. However, the song must be played on normal difficulty with no modifiers. Otherwise, it will not unlock.

Tips:
1. Usually, after you cut a note with a downswing, the next note will be an upswing, and vice versa. After getting a feel for it, you need to see where to swing on the first note only.
2. If you have difficulty getting high combos, don't worry about your score and full swings, as they are unnecessary for getting a nice combo.
3. Minimum 50 combo is campaign level 7a objective, so it is the best place to earn this.
4. If the song has enough notes, you can fail to get this combo multiple times during a song.
5. Breaking combo after hitting 50 does not void the achievement.

After the song is complete and you get 50 note combo or higher during any time in the song, the achievement will pop.
