_Get rank S on at least 15 different levels on hard difficulty (solo free play only)._

***

:trophy: **Guide written by a human**:

To unlock this achievement, you must earn an S rating on 15 songs on hard difficulty. Meaning your score must be above 80% of the available score.

Tips:
1. See the [Flawless achievement](Flawless.md) for more information on how to achieve a high rank on songs and how it is calculated.
2. Go for full combos, as it will drastically increase your odds of getting S rank even if your slice centrality is not great.
3. Play the song and strive for perfection. If you are comfortable with the game, go for SS rank directly so that S will come along the way.

After you complete your 15th (for some people, it's 16th) level, the achievement will pop. Good luck!

To get the Rank "S" and beat all of Level 1-20, you will need to complete each level with a high score. The harder it is for you to achieve that goal, the more points you'll earn when you do so! So start by practicing on easier levels until your skills are honed enough to tackle those higher difficulty ones. Hereâ€™s how: 
1) Start playing Beat_Saber in solo mode and select hard difficulty level for each gameplay session, since that will give the highest score multiplier (up to x5). This means you'll need a high-score of at least 20 on Level 3 before moving onto harder levels.
2) Once you have achieved this goal in solo mode with your current skill level and difficulty setting, try playing again but using different strategies or tactics that might help improve the score multiplier (either by increasing accuracy/speed of play OR decreasing damage taken). 
3) Keep practicing until you can achieve a high-score on at least Levels 4 through 20.
4) Once you have achieved this goal, repeat steps two and three again to try for higher scores or different strategies that might help improve the score multiplier even more! Remember: The harder it is for you to get Rank "S" in solo mode on hard difficulty level (Levels 3-20), the greater your reward will be when you finally do so.
