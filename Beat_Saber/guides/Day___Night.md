:trophy: **Guide written by a human**:

**Day & Night** is a grind achievement. Focus on other achievements, and this will come alongside them.

Few tips
1. Playtime only tracks when you are playing a song. The time you spend loading or sitting in a menu does not count towards the achievement, so usually, this will not align with the time shown by steam.
2. This is usually unlocked along the way with the other achievements. However, if you want to get this achievement without properly playing, or you are tired of the grind, you can always use the _No Fail_ modifier on one of the longer songs (i.e., "Angel Voices") and sit afk (NOT CLASSY!)

To get the achievement of playing Beat Saver for at least 24 continuous hours, you need to follow these steps. Firstly, open up your copy of Beat Safer and start a new game on any difficulty level that suits you best (easy mode is recommended). Once in-game, select one character from the available options and customize their appearance as desired before starting playtime.
Once started playing, make sure to keep track of time by using an external timer or clock if possible; this will ensure accuracy for your achievement progress tracking purposes later on. Play continuously until you have reached at least 24 hours played (or more) and then claim the 'Day & Night' Beat Saver achievement upon completion!
