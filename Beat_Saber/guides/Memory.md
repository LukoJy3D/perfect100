_Clear any level with disappearing arrows modifier._

***

To obtain this achievement, you need to clear any level with the disappearing arrows modifier (This modifier makes arrows on notes disappear shortly after the note spawns). 

Tips:
1. Play on the easiest difficulty if you find it challenging. 
2. Pay attention to the notes at the moment they spawn. 
3. If you missed the arrow's direction, swipe in the opposite direction than the previous note, as most levels are built this way.
4. Turn on the "No Fail" modifier with disappearing arrows. Such a modifier combo allows you to finish the level easily, and achievement is still valid.
