_Get rank S on at least 15 different levels on expert difficulty (solo free play only)._

***

To obtain this achievement, you need to get at least rank S on any 15 expert difficulty maps. Rank S is obtained when your overall accuracy is higher than 80%.

Some tips:
1. Try to make big swings and hit the notes as close to the center as possible. Hunters can find an explanation of score calculation in [Flawless achievement guide](Flawless.md).
3. Use modifiers that give you a better multiplier, such as "Faster Song", "Insta Fail", etc., but only do that if you're confident in your success.
4. Go for the full combo. Getting a full combo almost every time will result in an S rank.
