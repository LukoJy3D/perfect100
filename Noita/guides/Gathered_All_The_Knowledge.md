To gather all knowledge achievement, you need to complete the following steps. 1) Complete level one of Noita and obtain the first key item (the blue orb).  2) Use this key item on any door or gate in order to unlock it for future use.   3) Once inside a room with multiple objects, examine each object individually until you have gathered all knowledge about them from their descriptions/effects displayed when examined. 4) Finally, once you've collected enough information and gained access to the final area of Noita (the tower), defeat any enemies that stand in your way before facing off against the boss atop it!
