To reach 100% enemy progress, you need to defeat all the enemies and collect their loot. Here are some steps to follow:
- Start by defeating any available foes that appear on screen (they will be marked with a red exclamation mark). You can also find them in hidden areas or through exploration. 
- Once defeated, they'll drop items like health potions and ammo which you should collect to keep yourself alive longer during battles.
- As the game progresses, more enemies will appear on screen with increasingly difficult attacks that require quick reflexes from your part in order to survive them. 
- To defeat all foes requires a lot of practice as well as some luck and timing skills since they can be quite tricky at times. However, if you're persistent enough, it is possible for sure!
