To reach 100% perks progress, you need to complete all the available quests and achievements. Here are some steps on how to do it:
- Firstly, make sure that your character is at level 5 or higher as this will unlock more quest options for you. You can also earn XP by completing various tasks such as defeating enemies in combat scenarios.
- Once you have reached a high enough level and gained access to all available quests, start working on the achievements that are currently active (these change over time). Some of these may require specific actions or objectives within gameplay itself while others might be more passive tasks such as completing certain levels.
- Finally, once you have completed every quest and achieved everything else in the current update cycle for Noita, your perks progress will automatically unlock to 100%.
