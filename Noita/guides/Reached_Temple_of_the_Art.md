To reach temple level 10, you need to complete all previous levels and collect enough artifacts. Here are some steps to follow:
- Start by playing through each previously completed level until reaching Temple of the Art (level 9). You will receive a reward for completing this task.
- Once in Temple of the Art, use your collected artifacts on various statues scattered throughout the temple. Each statue has its own unique requirements to activate it and unlock new abilities or bonuses that can be used later in gameplay. 
- After collecting enough artifacts (at least three), you will receive a reward for reaching Temple of Art level 10, which is considered an achievement within the Noita universe.
