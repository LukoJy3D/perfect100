1) To start, you need to create an account on the official Cyberpunk 2077 website. This will allow you access to exclusive content such as updates and pre-order bonuses for when the game is released in September of this year (2021).

2) Once your account has been created, download the demo version from Steam or GOG Games. The demo allows players to experience a small portion of Cyberpunk 2077's world and mechanics before purchasing it on release day. It also includes exclusive content that can be unlocked by completing certain tasks within the gameplay itself, such as defeating specific enemies or exploring particular areas.

3) To start playing with a purpose in mind (i.e., to protect/serve), you need to select your character's class and gender at the beginning of Cyberpunk 2077’s campaign mode. This will determine which skills, weapons, equipment, and dialogue options are available for that particular playthrough.

4) Once in-game, players can choose from a variety of missions to complete tasks such as defending civilians or serving the Night City Police Department (NCPD). Completing these quests will earn you experience points which unlock new abilities and weapons for your character's skill tree.

5) To protect/serve, players can also choose from a variety of NPC characters to interact with throughout Cyberpunk 2077’s campaign mode. These interactions range in complexity but all have the potential to reward you with experience points or exclusive content such as weapons and equipment that are not available through other means within the gameplay itself.

6) Finally, players can choose from a variety of side missions which offer unique experiences outside Cyberpunk 2077’s main campaign mode. These quests range in difficulty but all have the potential to reward you with experience points or exclusive content such as weapons and equipment that are not available through other means within the gameplay itself.

Overall, players can choose from a variety of tasks throughout Cyberpunk 2077’s campaign mode which will allow them to unlock new abilities/weapons for their character's skill tree as well as exclusive content such as weapons and equipment that are not available through other means within the gameplay itself.
