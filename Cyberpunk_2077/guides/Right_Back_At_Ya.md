_Kill or incapacitate an enemy who threw a grenade at you._

***

To kill the grenadist, firstly identify them and locate their position. Then use your weapon of choice (such as sniper rifle) to target their head area for maximum damage. Alternatively, if they are incapacitated but still alive, aim for vital organs such as heart or lungs with a shotgun blast from close range.
