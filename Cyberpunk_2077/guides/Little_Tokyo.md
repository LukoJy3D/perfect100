1. Visit Night City and go to the Arasaka Industrial Area.

2. Look for a tall, red tower labeled “Little Tokyo” in the corner of the map.

3. When you enter the area, you will see a temple on the left side. Walk towards it, and you should find a shrine that is guarded by statues.

4. Interact with the shrine and perform a simple ceremony.

5. Once you've completed the ceremony, you will be rewarded with the steam achievement Little Tokyo.
