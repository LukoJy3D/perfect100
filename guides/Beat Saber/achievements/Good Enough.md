_Get at least rank A on any level on normal difficulty without any modifiers._

***

:trophy: **Guide written by a human**:

To obtain this achievement, you need to get at least rank A on any normal difficulty map with no modifiers. Rank A is obtained when your overall accuracy is higher than 65%.

Some tips:
1. Try to make big swings, because you get rewarded more points.
2. Try to hit the notes as close to the center as possible.

1. To get the highest possible score, you should focus your efforts towards getting as many combos (chaining together multiple successful attacks) and avoiding taking damage from enemies for too long. This will help increase your overall rankings in each level of Beat Saver without any modifiers enabled. 
2. You can also try to memorize the patterns that appear on-screen, which could give you an advantage over other players who are not familiar with them yet.
3. Another tip is to practice playing through levels at a slower pace and learn how enemies behave in different situations so as to avoid getting caught off guard by their attacks or movements.
4. Finally, it's important that you play the game on normal difficulty without any modifiers enabled since this will give you an accurate representation of your skills against other players who are also playing at a similar level and not using cheats/hacks like invincibility or infinite health boosters to gain unfair advantages.
