_Get full combo on at least 15 different levels on expert difficulty (solo free play only)._

:trophy: **Guide written by a human**:

To unlock this achievement, you must not miss a single note on 15 different songs on expert difficulty. 

Very similar to [**Drum Kit**](Drum_Kit.md), so the same tips apply:
1. Start on easier levels and make sure you can beat them with a full combo before proceeding to harder difficulties.
2. Some songs are easier than others, so choose levels that are less arm-breaking, such as "Legends", "Beat Saber", and the "100$ bills".
3. Play the songs with "No obstacles", "No bombs", and "Slower song" modifiers.
4. Focus on hitting all the notes and not worrying about the score.
5. If you have difficulty with stock maps, install custom ones.
6. Some achievements for some people, including **No Mistakes**, don't pop instantly after 15 successful levels and only unlock on the 16th, so keep hunting!

You can do this by playing through each level until you have achieved a full combo, then progressing onto the next one and repeating as necessary (there are no checkpoints or saves).
