_Get total score 100 million or more._

:trophy: **Guide written by a human**:

**100 Million** is a grind achievement. Focus on other achievements, and this will come alongside them.

Few tips:
1. Play songs until the end and not fail/restart the song. If you restart the song, in most cases, the score is not totaled. So sometimes it might seem like you're getting way more points than the achievement is tracking.
2. Expert+ gets tons of points per song once you get the hang of it. However, you can get tired real quick, so pace yourself!

Good luck!
