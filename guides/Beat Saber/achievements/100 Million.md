:trophy: **Guide written by a human**:

**100 Million** is a grind achievement. Focus on other achievements, and this will come alongside them.

Few tips:

1. Play songs until the end and not fail/restart the song. If you restart the song, in most cases, the score is not totaled. So sometimes it might seem like you're getting way more points than the achievement is tracking.
2. Expert+ gets tons of points per song once you get the hang of it. However, you can get tired real quick, so pace yourself!

Good luck!

To get the highest possible score, you need to collect as many coins and diamonds (the currency of Beat SaBer) as possible. Here are some tips that can help achieve this goal:

- Play through all levels in order starting from level 1 until reaching Level 20 or higher. This will give you enough time to earn more points by playing the game again, if needed.
- Collect coins and diamonds while playing each level as they are awarded for completing a task successfully (either collecting all items in one go or finding hidden objects). You can also purchase them from shops using real money.
  - Use power ups wisely to increase your score multiplier, which will multiply the points you earn by up to x10 times! Make sure not to waste any of these precious boosts on levels where they are unnecessary or ineffective (e.g., if there is no hidden object for you to find).
- Try out different strategies and tactics while playing each level, as this can help unlock new paths that lead towards more coins/diamonds!
  - Don't forget about the daily challenges offered by Beat SaBer. These are usually timed tasks with a fixed number of points to be earned within limited time frame (e.g., collecting all items in one go).
