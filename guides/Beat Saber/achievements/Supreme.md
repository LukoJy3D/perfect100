_Get full combo on any level on expert difficulty without any modifiers._

***

:trophy: **Guide written by a human**:

This achievement is similar to [No Mistakes](No_Mistakes.md), except you can't use modifiers. The same tips apply:
1. Start on easier levels and make sure you can beat them with a full combo before proceeding to harder difficulties.
2. Some songs are easier than others, so choose levels that are less arm-breaking, such as "Legends", "Beat Saber", and the "100$ bills".
3. If you are having difficulty with stock maps, you can try installing custom ones, as it might be way more motivating to slice away at the beat of your favorite song.

That same nasty way of creating your map applies here as well:
1. Open the map editor.
2. Make a level with a single note.
3. Play that level.

I would only recommend choosing the nasty way if this is your last achievement and you are bored with the game. However, Beat saber is a super fun game, and I still played it for 50+ hours after getting all achievements, so there is plenty of time to get that 100%.

:robot: **AI hallucinations**:

1. To start, you will need to practice and memorize the patterns of each level so that when it comes time for thematic challenges such as getting a combo or avoiding obstacles, they become second nature. This can be done through playing on beginner difficulty levels until mastery is achieved before moving up to expert mode.
2. Once you have reached an advanced skillset in the gameplay itself, consider using modifiers that will help improve your performance such as increasing health and damage output or decreasing enemy speed/damage. However, it's important not to rely too heavily on these since they can become crutches if overused.
3. Finally, once you have mastered the gameplay itself with no modifications whatsoever (which is a difficult task in its own right), focus solely on getting full combos without any modifiers applied at all. This will require extreme precision and timing to pull off successfully since there are many factors that can affect your ability such as enemy movement or environmental hazards like obstacles/pits.
