The Wandering Fool is a Steam achievement in Cyberpunk 2077. It requires players to travel over 15,000 kilometers in the game.

To achieve this Steam achievement, you’ll need to put in some important time and effort. For starters, take your time exploring Night City. Make sure to check out all the different districts, even ones you wouldn’t normally visit.

Walking through Night City will only get you a portion of the way, however. You’ll need to take on missions and side gigs. Do as many jobs as you can, and try to leave Night City for other areas. Taking on jobs will award you kilometers for the achievement.

It doesn’t stop there, though. If you want to really rack up the kilometers, hit up any nearby cities that can be reached by car. Coasting along the highways in your car or motorcycle will easily add up to the final 15,000.

One last tip: keep track of your kilometers. If you’re not sure how much more you need, consult your map and open the menu to see just how far you still have to go.
