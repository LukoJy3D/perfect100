Getting the Must Be Rats achievement in Cyberpunk_2077 is not particularly difficult. The only prerequisite is that you must have progressed far enough in the main quest line to reach Act 2. 

Once you are at Act 2, your first objective should be to start the side job “Chippin' In”. During this job, you will eventually be able to visit an underground hideout run by a group of hackers known as “The Voodoo Boys”. 

Inside the hideout, you'll need to defeat a number of enemies, including rats. Once all of them have been defeated, the achievement will unlock.
