Getting the "Rough Landing" achievement in Cyberpunk 2077 is fairly simple. All you need to do is take a fall from a great height and survive.

1. Find a tall building and go to the top. You can find tall buildings in different cities, including Heywood, Watson, Pacifica, City Centre,etc. 
2. Jump off the building. You can use your car or another object to jump off of if itâ€™s too high for you to jump on your own.
3. Make sure you have a Momentum power enabled. This power will slow down your fall and help you survive the impact.
4. Once you hit the ground, you will have earned the Rough Landing Achievement.
