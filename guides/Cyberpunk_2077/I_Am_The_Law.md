## I Am The Law

In order to get the I am the Law achievement in Cyberpunk 2077, you will need to complete all 20 NCPD Patrol cases in Night City. NCPD Patrol cases are side missions which involve solving a crime or calming a volatile situation. You can start these NCPD Patrol cases on the Job board found outside any police station in the city. 

The job boards are marked with a blue shield icon on the map. Once youâ€™ve accepted the case, simply make your way to the location, complete the objective and then return to the police station to report your findings. Once you have completed all 20 NCPD Patrol cases, the I am the Law achievement will be unlocked.
