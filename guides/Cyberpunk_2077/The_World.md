To get the "The World" achievement in Cyberpunk 2077, you need to finish all five main heists in the game. Here is a guide on how to do this:

1) The Heist of the Century: This is the introductory mission of the game which serves as a tutorial to the heists. You will be playing as Johnny Silverhand as you lead a team of V's to rob a corporate vault.

2) The Steel Maiden Heist: This is the second main heist in the game and you will need to steal a rare prototype robot from the Morrocorp building. To complete this heist, you will need to utilize stealth tactics to sneak your way in and out of the building without getting spotted.

3) The Redbrands Heist: This is the third main heist, and you will need to rob a Rache Bartmoss treasure from a Corpo safehouse. To complete this heist, you will need to use the environment to your advantage and set up distractions that will help you get past the guards and get to the treasure.

4) The Sixteenth Job Heist: This is the fourth main heist, and you will need to break into a bank, steal the money and escape without being caught. To complete this heist, you will need to use hacking skills to disable security systems and then use stealth to sneak through the bank undetected.

5) The Heist of the Golden Nugget: This is the fifth and final main heist, and you will need to infiltrate an impenetrable Corpo facility and steal a rare gold statue. To complete this heist, you will have to find a way through the facility without setting off alarms, break into the vault, and then make your escape with the statue.

Once you have completed all five of the main heists in Cyberpunk 2077, you will unlock the "The World" achievement. Good luck!
