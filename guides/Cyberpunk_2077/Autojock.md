To get the Autojock achievement in Cyberpunk 2077, you must first complete a total of 10 Fixer Contracts. To start a Fixer Contract, you will need to open up your phone and access the Fixer contracts menu at the bottom of the screen. You’ll find Fixer Contracts as an option in the Activities tab.

Once you have accepted your first Fixer Contract, you’ll need to complete 10 of them in total. The contracts themselves range from relatively simple activities such as delivering items to more involved tasks like assassinating a target.

After completing all 10 Fixer Contracts, you should receive a notification that you have completed the Autojock achievement and receive a corresponding trophy. Congratulations!
