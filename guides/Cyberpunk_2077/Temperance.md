The Temperance Achievement is earned by completing the mission in Cyberpunk 2077 titled "Transmission". In this mission, you must enter an underground data spawn to recover an incriminating file.

To get the Temperance Achievement, complete this mission without killing any enemies. Carefully avoid enemy encounters, use stealthy tactics like sneaking or using distractions, and hide any bodies you may find. Once you have completed the mission without killing anyone, you will be rewarded with the Temperance Achievement.
