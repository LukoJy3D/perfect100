:trophy: **Guide written by a human**:

It became quite challenging to achieve after the Phantom Liberty patch, as item looting was nerfed, however, it's still doable while completing all the side missions, gigs, data mines. To unlock this achievement, you will need to be at least **level 50 street cred** (Aerondight S9 Guinevere will be unlocked) and earn around **~2 million eddies** (1 949 000...I think).

Before the Phantom Liberty patch, there were 26 vehicles to buy. Now, there are 30ish. Here is the list of all vehicles (those with costs): https://cyberpunk2077.wiki.fextralife.com/Vehicles

I wouldn't bother with buying vehicles early game as you can find Rayfield Caliburn (one of the fastest cars) for free in the Badlands after you progress with Panam and just buy all the remaining vehicles at the end of the game, as most of it will probably will be listed in the journal.
