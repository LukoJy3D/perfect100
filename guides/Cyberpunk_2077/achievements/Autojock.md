:trophy: **Guide written by a human**:

It became quite challenging to achieve after the Phantom Liberty patch, as item looting was nerfed, however, it's still doable while completing all the side missions, gigs, data mines. To unlock this achievement, you will need to be at least **level 50 street cred** (Aerondight S9 Guinevere will be unlocked) and earn around **~2 million eddies** (1 949 000...I think).

Before the Phantom Liberty patch, there were 26 vehicles to buy. Now, there are 30ish. Here is the list of all vehicles (those with costs): https://cyberpunk2077.wiki.fextralife.com/Vehicles

I wouldn't bother with buying vehicles early game as you can find Rayfield Caliburn (one of the fastest cars) for free in the Badlands after you progress with Panam and just buy all the remaining vehicles at the end of the game, as most of it will probably will be listed in the journal.

To buy the cars and other transportation options, you need to follow these steps. Firstly, go into your inventory screen where you can see what items are currently in possession of 'Autojock' character. Next, scroll down through each vehicle that is listed on this page until you find one or more vehicles that catches your eye and interests you the most. Once found click onto it to view its details such as price tag etc.. Then go ahead with buying them by clicking "buy" button which will take you into a new screen wherein, after confirming payment method (if any) of 'Autojock' character then finally buy that vehicle or transportation option.
