:trophy: **Guide written by a human**:

There are a total of **6** items to collect, and 3 of them are missable (previously, it was possible to dismantle some items, but it was fixed in patch 1.x). Here is the list of items you need to collect to unlock the achievement:

1. **Johnny's Tank Top** - Found in the main story mission **Tapeworm** (obtained automatically, will be in your inventory after the mission is completed).
2. **Johnny's Aviators** - Found in the main story mission **Chippin' In** (obtained automatically, will be in your inventory after the mission is completed).
3. **Johnny's Samurai Jacket** - Found in the main story mission **Chippin' In** (obtained automatically, will be in your inventory after the mission is completed).
4. **Johnny's Gun (MISSABLE!!!)** - Found in the main story mission **Chippin' In**. However, you have to pick it up by using the "Take gun" option in dialogue.
5. **Johnny's Pants (MISSABLE!!!)** - Can be found during the gig "Psychofan". The pants will be in the suitcase in the bedroom on the second floor of apartment 1702. The gig itself should appear early in the game from the fixer Sebastian Ibarra.
6. **Johnny's Shoes (MISSABLE!!!)** - Can be looted in the same locker as the recording/shard (which is the objective) during the gig "Family Heirloom". Rogue gives the gig after progressing with Panam's questline and hitting street cred level 35+. Marking it as missable because you can be a picky looter.

To collect the items belonging to Johnny Silverhand, you will need to complete various quests and side missions throughout Cyperpunk 2077. Here are some steps to help guide your journey towards this achievement:

1. Begin by exploring Night City's streets as they were in the year of 2085 (the gameâ€™s setting). You will encounter various NPC characters who can provide you with quests and missions that lead you closer to collecting all items belonging to Johnny Silverhand.
2. As your journey progresses, keep an eye out for any clues or hints regarding the whereabouts of these missing objects. Some may be hidden in secret locations while others might require specific actions from you before they can be obtained.
3. Once you have collected all items belonging to Johnny Silverhand (which will likely take several hours), your achievement should unlock automatically upon completion!
