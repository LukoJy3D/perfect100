To steal an Araksa Medical Truck from Cyberpunk 2077, you will need a high level of hacking skill. Firstly, locate and identify any available trucks in the game world that are marked as 'Arakawa' medical vehicles on your map or radar screen. Once identified, attempt to steal them by using one of Cyberpunk 2077’s many methods for hacking into systems such as keycard scanning and password guessing. If successful in gaining access to the vehicle you will be able to drive it away from its current location or sell/trade it on the black market.
To deliver vehicles, simply follow any available delivery missions that are offered by NPCs within Cyberpunk 2077’s world and complete them in order to earn rewards such as money or experience points for your character's development.
