1. Open the Cyberspace menu and select "Achievements" from there.

3. Read through any requirements or prerequisites that may be necessary before attempting the task at hand, such as completing a specific quest or acquiring certain items/weapons.
4. Once you have gathered all of your materials and are ready for action, head to where The Wheel is located in Cyberspace (it should appear on your map).
5. Use whatever method necessary - be it hacking into the system's security or simply finding a way around obstacles blocking access.
