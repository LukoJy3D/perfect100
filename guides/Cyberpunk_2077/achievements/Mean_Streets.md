1. To complete the Gigs, you need to go through each of them one by one until they are completed successfully. Here's how it works: 
  * Firstly, head over to Heyward (Heyward is a district located on the outskirts of Night City) and start completing gigs that will be assigned to you as per your characterâ€™s skills or interests. You can also choose from various options available in the gameplay menu such as being an enforcer, mercenary etc.. 
  * Once a Gig is completed successfully it unlocks new missions and quests for players which are known as NCPD Scanner Hustles (Night City Police Department Scaners). These scanner hunt will be assigned to you by the police department. You need to complete them in order to progress through the gameplay.. 
  * In conclusion, completing all Gigs and NCPD Scanner Husstle is a great way for players to unlock new content within Cyberpunk_2077's world of Night City
