To successfully play through Cyberpunk 2077, players must complete various objectives and quests throughout their journey. Here is an overview on how to unlock the "Life of the Road" achievement in this game:
1) Start by exploring Night City's streets as much as possible during your playthrough. This will help you discover hidden items, collectibles or even new missions that can be completed for extra XP and rewards. 
2) As players progress through Cyberpunk 2077 they may encounter various NPC characters who offer quests to complete in exchange for experience points (XP). It is recommended to accept as many of these sidequests as possible, since completing them will also unlock the "Life of the Road" achievement.
3) Another way players can earn XP and progress towards this goal is by engaging with various factions within Night City's underworld. By participating in missions for each group (either through dialogue options or simply completing tasks), they will unlock new quests, items and even more experience points to help them reach the "Life of the Road" achievement goal.
4) Finally, players should also keep an eye out on their radios as there are various radio stations that can be discovered throughout Night City which offer missions or sidequests for completion in exchange for XP boosting items and rewards.
