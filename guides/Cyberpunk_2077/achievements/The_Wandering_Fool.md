To find all of The Wandering Foolâ€™s Tarot graffiti, you will need to complete several tasks. Firstly, head over to the Hill District and speak with a local merchant named Tiffany who can provide some insight into where they might be located in this area. Once there, look for any murals or paintings that appear to have been painted by someone called The Wandering Fool - these are likely Tarot graffiti left behind as part of their job on the Hill District. You will need to search each building and location thoroughly until you find all 12 pieces scattered throughout this area, which should unlock 'The Wanderer' achievement in Cyberpunk_2077 for The Wandering Fool character class!
