 1) To start with, you need to create an account on the official Cyberpunk 2077 website and download their client. Once installed, launch it from your desktop or Start Menu shortcuts. You can also access this game through Steam if preferred.  

2) After downloading and installing the Client, click "Play" in order to start playing the game. This will take you into Cyberpunk 2077's world where you are free to explore as much or little of it as desired. You can also choose between different characters with unique abilities that may be helpful for unlocking The Fooled achievement, such as V in Night City Police Department (NCPD) and Johnny Silverhand from the Merchant Guilds.  

3) Once you've chosen your character or created a new one if desired, head to any of Cyberpunk 2077's many locations like The Wasteland District in Night City where there are various quests that can be completed for experience points and unlocking achievements.  

4) As you progress through the game completing tasks such as missions, sidequests or exploring different districts of Cyberpunk 2077's world, your character will gain XP which is required to level up in order to access new abilities and unlock The Fooled achievement.  

5) Once you have reached the necessary experience points needed for this particular task (which can be found on a quest or sidequest), head back into Night City Police Department's office where your character will receive an email from their superior officer, which is actually part of Cyberpunk 2077's storyline.  

6) In the message you received in-game, there should be some sort of clue or hint that can lead to unlocking The Fooled achievement if followed correctly. It could also include a password for an online database where more information about this task is located.   

7) Once you have found and decoded all the necessary clues from your superior officer's message, head back into Night City Police Department again to speak with their colleague who will provide some additional details that can help unlock The Fooled achievement if followed correctly.  

8) After following through on this task successfully (which should be noted in-game), you may receive a reward or bonus for completing it, which could include new abilities and/or items to use during gameplay.
