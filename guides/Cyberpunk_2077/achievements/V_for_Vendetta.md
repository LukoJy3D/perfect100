1. To complete this task successfully and unlock V for Vendemmia achievement in Cyberpunk 2077 game, follow these steps:-

- Firstly, after reviving with Second Heart ability (which is acquired at level 3), you need to kill or incapsulate the enemy who killed you within five seconds. This task can be completed by using any of your weapons like guns and melee attacks on them. However, it's important that they are not too far away from you when reviving with Second Heart ability is activated as this will give you more time to kill or incapsulate the enemy who killed you within five seconds.
- After killing/incapping your opponent successfully, a message confirming achievement unlock would be displayed on screen and also in-game notification for players' profile.
