1) Firstly, you need to complete the tutorial mission. This will give you an understanding of how combat and exploration works within Cyberpunk 2077. You can also learn about different skills that are available for your character's development in this section as well.  

2) After completing the tutorial, head over to Night City where you have access to a variety of missions which will help unlock Spin Doctor achievement. Some notable ones include: 
- The Wheelchair Mission - This mission is located at the Cyberpunk Cafe in Night City and requires you to complete it with your wheelchaired character, who has been kidnapped by a gangster named 'The Boss'. You will need to fight off his henchmen while trying not to get caught.
- The Cleaning Mission - This mission is located at the Cyberpunk Cafe in Night City and requires you to clean up after patrons who have been drinking too much alcohol, which can be quite challenging due to their intoxicated state! 
3) Once you've completed these missions successfully (or even if not), head over to the Cyberpunk Cafe again. This time around, speak with a character named 'The Boss', who will give you access to more Spin Doctor achievement unlocking quests that are located in Night City and beyond! 
4) Finally, make sure to keep an eye out for any additional missions or tasks which may be available through the game's online community. These can often provide helpful hints on how best to achieve your goal of becoming a Spin Doctor within Cyberpunk 2077.
