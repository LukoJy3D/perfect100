1. To start, you will need to equip your character with the best possible weaponry for taking out foes from afar. This means investing in a sniper rifle and/or assault rifles that have high damage output at long ranges. 
2. Once armed up, it's time to head into Cyberpunk_2077's world of Night City where you will find plenty of enemies for your character True Soldier to take on in the gameplay mode 'Kill or Incapacitate'.
3. To complete this achievement/task successfully requires that 300 foes are killed using range weapons, so it is important not only to have a good weapon but also be skilled at its use and aiming abilities. You will need to practice with your sniper rifle or assault riffles until you can hit targets consistently from afar without missing too many shots in the process of killing 300 enemies using range weapons..
4. Once True Soldier has mastered his/her weaponry, it's time for him to head out into Night City and start taking on foes one by one until he reaches a total number of kills that equals or exceeds 300 in the 'Kill Or Incapacitate' mode.
5. To complete this task successfully requires True Soldier be skilled at using his/her sniper rifle, assault riffles and aiming abilities to hit targets consistently from afar without missing too many shots while taking out 300 enemies in the 'Kill or Incapacitate' mode.
6. Once you have reached your target number of kills using range weapons (i.e., sniper rifle and/or assault riffles), it is time to celebrate with True Soldier as he has achieved his goal!
