To complete the task of completing All Cyberspyho sighting, you need to follow these steps. 
1) Go into your inventory and equip yourself with a camera that can record video or audio. You will also require some batteries for it as well.  
2) Once equipped, start exploring different areas in the game world where there are high chances of Cyberpsycho sightings occurring such as abandoned buildings, sewers etc.. 
3) Keep an eye out and record any suspicious activity that you come across while playing through these locations. You will need to be vigilant about it because some people may try to avoid being recorded by hiding or fleeing the scene when they spot your camera recording them.  
4) Once done, upload all of those videos/audio files onto a cloud storage service such as Google Drive and share with other players who are also looking for Cyberpsycho sightings in order to unlock achievement 'I Am The Law'.
