1. To shoot the grenade, you will need to have acquired it first by either picking up or looting its remains after being shot down from above. Once obtained, equip your Revolver and aim at where you think the enemy is located in mid-air (you can use a radar if available).
2. Pull back on the trigger until the grenade explodes to confirm that it was successfully fired upon by using the game's physics engine or other visual cues such as smoke, debris and/or damage indicators. 
3. Congratulations! You have now unlocked 'Gunslinger'.
