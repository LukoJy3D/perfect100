1. Play through the tutorial and learn how to control your character.
2. Complete all of the side quests you can find while exploring the world, as these will often offer valuable rewards or experience points that could be helpful later on in the gameplay.
3. Learn about the different types of weapons available for use by Tempestance and choose one to specialize with if possible (either a melee weapon like daggers/knives or ranged ones such as guns).
4. Pay attention to your character's stats, especially their health points. It is important that you keep them high in order to survive longer battles against enemies and bosses later on in the gameplay.
5. Learn about different types of skills available for Tempestance such as hacking or lockpicking which can be useful during missions where they are required, but also consider investment into other skill trees that might come handy at a future date (such as stealth).
6. Pay attention to the game's difficulty settings and choose one accordingly. The higher difficulties will offer more challenges for Tempestance in terms of enemies or boss battles later on, but also require better strategies from you if they are too difficult to handle at first levels.
