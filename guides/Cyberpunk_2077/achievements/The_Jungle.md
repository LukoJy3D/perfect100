1. To complete the first NCPD scanner hustling, you need to go through the following steps: 
  * Go into your inventory menu (press 'I' on controller)
  * Press Y or B for yes/no if prompted by a message that says "Scan Scanner" and select it. This will activate NCPD scanner hustling in Santo Domingo.
