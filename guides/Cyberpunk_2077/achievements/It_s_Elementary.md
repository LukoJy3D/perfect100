To complete the achievement "It’s Elementary" in Cyberpunk 2077, you will need to finish a total of five missions. These include completing 'The School' mission for the National Crime Investigation Department (NCID) and all gigs available through Watson. Here are some steps that can help achieve this:
1. Start by locating Watson in your game world. You should be able to find him/her at a location near you, or simply ask NPCs where he is located for assistance. 2. Once you have found Watson, select the 'Gigs' option from his menu and choose one of them that interests you most (either by its description or difficulty level). You can also filter gigs based on their availability in your current location if needed.
3. Complete all available missions for each individual Gig before moving onto another, as completing a single mission will not count towards the achievement's completion. 
4. Once you have completed every one of Watson’s gigs (including any extras), return to him/her and select 'NCPD Scanner Hustles'.
5. Now it is time for some detective work! You can start by scanning objects in your environment, such as vehicles or people's belongings that might hold clues about a crime scene you are investigating. 
6. Once you have found enough evidence to link suspects together and identify the culprit(s), return back to Watson with what you’ve discovered for him/her to analyze it further in order to complete your investigation successfully, which will unlock "It's Elementary" achievement!
