To kill/incapacitate 100 enemies with melee weapons, you need the following steps. Firstly, equip your character (True Warrior) with a sword and shield combination that can take down multiple foes at once. Secondly, focus on enemy types such as mages or soldiers who are more vulnerable to physical attacks than others like snipers/assault rifle users. Thirdly, use the environment around you for cover while attacking enemies from behind them. Last but not least is to practice and hone your skills with melee weapons in order to become a deadlier opponent against foes onscreen.
