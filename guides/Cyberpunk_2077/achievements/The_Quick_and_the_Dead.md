1. Open Cybersport mode on your console/PC, select The Quick & the Dead achievement and start playing through any of the available missions in Cyberpunk_2077 game. You can also choose to play solo or with a teammate if you want more support during this task.
2. Once inside the mission area, look for enemies that are marked as red on your map screen (these will be highlighted). Kill them by any means possible and make sure they die before time runs out which is 5 minutes in total or when all of their health bars deplete whichever comes first
3. Once you have killed enough foes, the achievement should unlock automatically as long as it's your first playthrough on that mission mode (if not then repeat steps until completion).
