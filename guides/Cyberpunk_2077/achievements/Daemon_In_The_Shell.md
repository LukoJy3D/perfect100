To kill three enemies using the detonation grenades, you will need to first obtain them. To do this, head over to a vendor and purchase some from there (you can also find them in lootable containers). Once obtained, equip one of these explosives on your character's hand or wrist by double-clicking it with the left mouse button while aimed at an enemy target.
Then press R1/Right Trigger to throw and detonate grenade when you see a green icon appear above their heads (indicating that they are within range). This will kill them instantly, but beware of any nearby allies or teammates who may also take damage from the explosion.
Repeat this process three times with different enemies to achieve your goal and unlock 'Daemon In The Shell' achievement in Cyberpunk 2077!
