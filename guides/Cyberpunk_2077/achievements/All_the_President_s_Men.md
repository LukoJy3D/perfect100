1. To save president Meyers, you need to complete his questline which is located on the map of Night City.
2. Once inside Night City's police station, head towards the interrogation room where you will find a prisoner named "President Meyer". You can then interact with him and choose between two options: either release or torture President Meyers to get information about Cyberpunk_2077.
3. Afterwards, you need to complete another questline which is located on the map of Night City's sewers where you will find a secret passageway that leads into an abandoned laboratory.
4. Inside this labyrinthine facility, there are several scientists who can provide information about Cyberpunk_2077 and its secrets if properly interrogated or incentivized with money/items.
