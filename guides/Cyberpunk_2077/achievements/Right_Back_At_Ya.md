1. To complete this task, firstly locate the person that has thrown a grenade towards you and kill them before they detonate it by using your weapons such as guns/knives etc., if any are available to use in 'Cyberpunk_2077'. 
2. If no weapon is found nearby or there's only one person, try to subdue the enemy with a melee attack and then finish them off before they detonate their grenade by using your hands/fists etc., if any are available in 'Cyberpunk_2077'. 
3. If none of these options work or you're unable to locate anyone nearby, try to run away from the explosion as far and fast as possible before it detonates so that there is no damage done on your end by using any available means in 'Cyberpunk_2077'. 
4. If none of these options work or you're unable to locate anyone nearby, try to use a grenade launcher/grenades etc., if they are found and accessible during the gameplay session in 'Cyperpunk _2077', which can be used as an alternative way to kill your opponent before their explosive device detonates.
