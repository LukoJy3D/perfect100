To craft three legendary items, you will need the following materials:
1. X amount of Y material (specify what each item needs)
* For example - To make a legendary sword with steel and adamantium requires 50 units of iron ore and 20 units of diamond dust.
   
You can find these items by exploring the world or completing quests/missions that require them as rewards, but you may also need to purchase some materials from merchants in town if they are not found naturally during your adventures.
