To complete this task you will need two things; one is an appropriate weapon and secondly, some skill. The most effective way of completing it would be using a scoped assault rifle such as the AK-103 or M4A1 Carbine with high damage per shot (DPM) like .50 BMG DPIC Sniper Rifles and 7x62mm Dragunov snipper.
You will need to aim for both targets at once, so you can't afford any mistakes in your shooting skills or the weaponry used. You should try to get as close as possible without being detected by either target before taking a shot with your rifle and then quickly ducking out of sight until they are downed.
Once you have successfully killed both targets, congratulations! Your achievement is now unlocked in the game 'Cyberpunk 2077'.
