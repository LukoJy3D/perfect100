## The Hermit

This steam achievement is unlocked automatically when you earn the "Hermit" Perk from Johnny Silverhand. This is a part of the main quest in Cyberpunk 2077. In order to obtain the perk, you must complete the quest "Chippin' In" and then do 3 things:

1. Free up Johnny's body: By talking to Dum Dum, a fixer in Watson, you can progress this side mission.

2. Buy the equipment for Johnny: With the credits remaining after buying the equipment for Johnny, buy a safehouse in Santo Domingo.

3. Use the life path: Decide which life path to take and make sure you follow it to the end.

Once you complete the above tasks, Johnny will give you access to the Hermit perk which unlocks this achievement.
