Step 1: Go to the Vista Del Rey district in the Santa Domingo region of the Night City map.

Step 2: On the left side of the district, you’ll find a bridge that leads you onto the roof of a tall building. If you take the stairs, you’ll eventually reach the top of the building and be rewarded with a stunning view of the cityscape.

Step 3: Once you get to the top, you’ll automatically gain the “Breathtaking” steam achievement!
