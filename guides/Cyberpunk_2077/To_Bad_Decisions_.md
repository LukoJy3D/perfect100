To unlock the To Bad Decisions! achievement in Cyberpunk 2077, you will need to complete a main job called “Life During Wartime”. This job is part of the Act 2 story and involves a mission in which V visits Skye Larsen’s apartment. During this mission, V will have a chance to make several choices, some of which are not the best ones to make. To get the achievement, you must choose the “bad” options and make decisions that can lead to a tragic outcome.
