## It's Elementary

To get the “It’s Elementary” steam achievement in Cyberpunk 2077, you will need to complete the quest, “Elementary.” This is a side job that can be found in Westbrook, near the Afterlife nightclub. To start this quest, walk up to the homeless people nearby and talk to them. They will give you a box that needs to be delivered to a man named Viktor.

From here, follow the on-screen quests to locate and talk to Viktor. Once you have done this, he will ask you to look for some “swag.” You need to find 3 items (an old hat, an old pocket watch, and an old pipe) located in a crashed car at the spot marked on your map. Grab these items and return to Viktor to complete the quest and unlock the achievement.
