To reach snowy depthths, you need to complete the quest titled "Snowy Dephth" which is located on level 2 of Noita. To do this, follow these steps:
1) Head over to Level 2 in the game and start exploring until you find a cave entrance that looks like it'll lead somewhere interesting (it should be marked with an exclamation mark). Enter through there!
2) Once inside, keep following the path as far down into the depths of Noita as possible. You may encounter some obstacles along the way - if so, you can try to solve them or simply backtrack until you find a better route (you'll know it when you see one). Eventually though, your exploration will lead you right up against an iceberg!
3) Now that we have reached snowy depthths in Noita, let us celebrate with some victory laps.
