:trophy: **Guide written by a human**:

Create an infinite lifetime projectile. Mods must be disabled to obtain this achievement.

Infinite lifetime spells can be created when a spell's lifetime is equal to 0. This can be achieved by using modifier spells, which affect spells' lifetime. A fantastic guide about this can be found on the Noita wiki [Guide page](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Guide:_Infinite_Lifetime_Spells)
