:trophy: **Guide written by a human**:

**Use** every spell at least once (holding doesn't count). The majority of the spells can be obtained randomly on wands or shops. However, there are quite a lot of unlockable ones that require you to do secrets. It is by far the most time-consuming achievement, as some secrets can take up to 10 hours to do (depending on your luck and game knowledge).

Information about spells can be found on Noita wiki [Spells page](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Spells) (spoilers)

A cheesy way to do this achievement would be to install mods and spawn every single spell. However, I do not recommend this because you will miss out on a lot of what this game has to offer.
