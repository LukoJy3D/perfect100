:trophy: **Guide written by a human**:

Beat the game. Most straightforward way to achieve this is to play the game how it's implied (by going down to the caves) and beating the boss after the seventh area of the game. You will need to put in some hours and get good at the game as this requires a lot of luck. And try not to rush, as most of the deaths occur when you're not being patient.
If you still have difficulties getting this then I'd suggest trying to do some secrets as they unlock some powerful spells that make beating the game way easier.

1) To win Victory, you must first complete the tutorial level and learn how to play Noita properly. 
2) Once you have mastered playing through levels with various weapons such as swords or axes, try using a bow for added range in combat situations.
3) Aside from learning different types of attacks, it is also important to understand enemy AI behavior so that you can anticipate their moves and counter them effectively.
4) To achieve Victory, make sure your character has enough health potions on hand at all times as well as ample supplies such as food or water for survival purposes.
5) Finally, remember the importance of exploration in Noita since it is where you will find hidden treasures and upgrades that can help you win Victory!
