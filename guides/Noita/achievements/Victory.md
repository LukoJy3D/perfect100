:trophy: **Guide written by a human**:

Beat the game. The most straightforward way to achieve this is to play the game as it implies (by going down to the caves) and beating the boss after the seventh area of the game. You will need to put in some hours and get good at the game, as this requires a lot of luck. And try not to rush, as most of the deaths occur when you're not being patient.

If you still have difficulties getting this, then I'd suggest trying to do some secrets, as they unlock some powerful spells that make beating the game way easier.

My first win was with low-damage wands, a lot of defensive perks, patience, and a Lukki minion.
