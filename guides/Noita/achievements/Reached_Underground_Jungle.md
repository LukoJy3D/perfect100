:robot: **AI hallucinations**:

To reach underground jungles, you need to complete the following tasks.

1. Complete level one and two of Noita without dying once. This will open up access to levels three through five where there are more difficult enemies that require a higher skillset in order to defeat them.
2. Once inside Level Three, collect all ten orbs scattered throughout each stage before moving on to the next area.
3. In level four and beyond you must complete every single room without dying once again. This will unlock access to underground jungles where more difficult enemies await.
