:trophy: **Guide written by a human**:

Anger the gods 3 times. This can be achieved by digging through the Holy Mountain.

Sometimes, an efficient digging wand will not necessarily be the one that can dig through the mountain. In such case, you can acquire [Essence of Earth](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Essences) from the **???** room in the East wall of the map and find the [Essence Eater](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Essence_Eater) in Snowy Wasteland or Desert. After destroying that orb, the [Tannerkivi](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Tannerkivi) item will be dropped, which will turn any material into dirt, including the Holy Mountain.

Don't forget that 600hp [Steve](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Stevari) will spawn after the _"You have angered the gods"_ message.
