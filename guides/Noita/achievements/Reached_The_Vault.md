:trophy: **Guide written by a human**:

Reach the sixth area of the game.

:robot: **AI hallucinations**:

1. To reach level 5, you need at least three stars. You can earn these by completing levels with the highest score possible (without using any power-ups). This will require some practice and skillful play!
2. Once you have reached Level 5, you'll unlock a new feature called "The Vault". To access it, simply tap on your character icon in the main menu. You can then choose to either open or close The Vault by tapping again (if already opened). Inside is an array of rewards and bonuses for completing various tasks within Noita's world!
3. One such task you may want to consider trying out would be "The Secret Mission". This requires finding a hidden object in each level, which can earn you some extra stars. You will need to play through the levels again (or try new ones!) until you find all of them and unlock this achievement!
4. Another task that could help is exploring every corner of Noita's world by playing different modes such as Arcade Mode, Survival Mode or Time Trial. This will give you a better understanding on how to play the game effectively which can lead to more stars and unlocking The Vault achievement!
5. Lastly but not least is that there are various power-ups in Noita's world such as "The Shield" (which protects your character from enemy attacks), or "Sparkle Ball", a special item which can be used to clear all enemies on the screen. You may want to try using these items strategically during levels for better scores and unlocking The Vault achievement!
