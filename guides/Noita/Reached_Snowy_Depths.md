1. Find the cave in the deep Snowy Depths biome. The biome is located on the far left side of the map and the entrance to the cave is at the very bottom of the biome.

2. Enter the cave and head all the way down, going through the tunnels and rooms, until you reach the un-lit chamber at the bottom.

3. When you enter the un-lit chamber you will need to light it up by using a spell like Fireball or Sparks.

4. Once the chamber is lit, the achievement will be unlocked.
