1. Start a new game and try to reach the bottom-most possible depth (pick an adventurer with high jumping ability to make it easier).

2. From the bottom-most depth, search for an Exit marker (green circle with a plus symbol inside) that leads you to the Underground Jungle.

3. Upon entering the underground jungle, activate any Witch Portal located there to trigger the achievement.
