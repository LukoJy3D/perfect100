To earn 100% enemy progress, you need to defeat all enemies and collect their loot. Here are the steps needed for this achievement:
- Start playing Noita on any difficulty level (easy or normal).
- Once inside a dungeon/level, start defeating waves of monsters until they're defeated completely. You can use various weapons to defeat them like swords and axes etc., but make sure you have enough health potions for yourself as well since the enemies will also attack back if necessary. 
- After each wave is over, collect all loot that has been dropped by your foes (gold coins or other items). This includes any treasure chests found on the map too!
- Once you've collected enough gold to buy a new weapon/armor from shops in town, equip it and start defeating enemies again. 
- Repeat this process until all monsters have been defeated completely (i.e., no more waves or loot drops). You will then earn the '100% Enemy Progress' achievement!
