Getting 100% Enemy Progress in Noita is a very time consuming task and can be quite difficult. The easiest way to go about it is to make sure you have the right loadout and items to help you defeat all the enemies in the game.

First, make sure that you have at least one weapon that does enough damage to take down enemies quickly. The basic magical wand or the advanced spiritual wand are both great for this purpose. You may also want to obtain some magical upgrades like Ghostly Charm, Mana Retention, and Charged Shot to further increase the power of your wand.

Second, make sure you have enough health and mana regeneration to survive long fights with enemies. Health regeneration can be increased by obtaining enough life regeneration scrolls or by having multiple hearts. Mana regeneration can be increased by obtaining mana regeneration scrolls or by wearing the Magic Boosting Hat.

Third, make sure you have the items necessary to clear out large groups of enemies. These include bombs, freeze spells, fireball spells and more. Having several of these items in your inventory will make it easier to take down large packs of enemies quickly.

Finally, equip yourself with as many resistances as you can. This will help reduce the damage you take from enemy attacks and allow you to stay alive in fights longer. Also make sure to keep a look out for enemy spawn points and try to take them out before they can spawn more enemies. With enough determination and the right strategies, you can get 100% Enemy Progress in no time. Good luck!
