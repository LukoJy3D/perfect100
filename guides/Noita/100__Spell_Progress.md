To reach 100% spell progress, you need to cast spells on all the enemies encountered during your playthrough. Here are some steps to follow:
- Cast every single spell that is available for use against an enemy in Noita's world map screen (not including bosses). This will unlock new abilities and upgrades as well, which can be used later on when facing more difficult enemies or challenging situations. 
- Once you have cast all the spells possible from your inventory of available options against an enemy in Noita's world map screen (not including bosses), then it is time to move onto a new area and repeat this process again, until every single spell has been used on each type of monster encountered.
