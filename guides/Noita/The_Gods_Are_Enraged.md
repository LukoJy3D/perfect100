1. First, you will need to find the Enraged God’s altar – it’s located in the Underwater Depths biome, which is accessed via a submerged cave entrance in the Ocean biome.

2. Once you enter the Underwater Depths, you will need to locate the altar and collect the three components that make up the Eye of the Deep, an object required for the achievement: a red gem, a blue gem, and an egg. 

3. After all three components have been collected, place them on the altar and interact with it. This will summon the enraged god and unlock the achievement.
