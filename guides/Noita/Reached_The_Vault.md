## Reached The Vault

1. Activate the Monoliths - Before you attempt to access the vault, you need to activate the four monoliths scattered around the world. Once activated, they will open up a portal to the vault. To activate each monolith, find and interact with the four nerve clusters located underneath each of the monuments. 

2. Reach the Vault - The portal will be unlocked once all four monoliths are activated. Make your way to the portal and choose to enter. 

3. The Final Dungeon - Inside the vault, you will find a series of puzzles and monsters that must be navigated to reach the end. This can be quite difficult, so prepare for a long trip!

4. Unlock the Chest - Once you have reached the end of the dungeon, you will come across a chest. Interact with it to unlock the achievement.
