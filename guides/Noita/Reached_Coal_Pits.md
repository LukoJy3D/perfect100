To reach coal pits achievement, you need to collect 10 or more coins from the mines. To do this, follow these steps:
  1. Start by exploring one of the mine shafts located in different parts of Noita's world map. You can find them on your minimap if it is turned on. Look for a green icon that represents an active mineshaft. 2. Once you spot such a location, approach and enter to start digging coal from its depths using the pickaxe tool (default key). Keep collecting until you have gathered at least ten or more coins before exiting through any of the exits available in that particular mine shaft.
  3. After gathering enough coals for your achievement, head to one of Noita's towns and exchange them with a merchant who is willing to buy coal from players like you (default key). You can also sell it directly at an auction house if there are any available in the town where you currently reside.
  4. Once you have enough coins, head back into your game world map again for another mine shaft and repeat steps 2-3 until reaching 'Reached Coal Pit' achievement status!
