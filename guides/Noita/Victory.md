_Victory_

---

To achieve victory, you need to defeat all enemies and collect enough resources (gold/wood) throughout the levels of Noita. To do this, start by exploring each level thoroughly for hidden paths or shortcuts that can help speed up your journey through the game world. Once you have found these secrets, use them strategically in order to avoid unnecessary battles and collect as much gold and wood along the way possible. Additionally, be sure to upgrade your character's abilities with each level completed by using collected resources wisely on upgrading skills such as health or attack damage. Finally, once you have defeated all enemies within a given area of Noita, return there again for additional loot that can help further improve your characters stats and overall performance in the game world!
