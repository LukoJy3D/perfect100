_Victory_

---

Getting Victory in Noita is relatively straightforward. The first step is to reach the end of the game. This means fighting your way through all the levels and defeating the final boss. Then, after beating the game, you'll be presented with a screen displaying a "Victory" message. Simply press the Enter key and the achievement will be unlocked.

You can also get the Victory achievement by using a cheat code. To do this, start up Noita and enter the following code while at the main menu: press SHIFT + ALT + G. This will give you instant access to all levels in the game, allowing you to finish the game quickly. Once you reach the ending, the Victory achievement will be yours!
