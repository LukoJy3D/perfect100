To unlock the "Two Heads, One Bullet" achievement in Cyberepunk 2077, you need to kill or incapacitate two enemies using a single sniper rifle shot. Here are the steps that can help you achieve this feat:
1. Find and approach the first enemy that needs to be killed/incapacitated.
2. Aim your weapon at them from a distance of about 30-40 meters (100-130 feet).
3. Take aim and fire one shot, aiming for their head or torso. Make sure you have enough bullets left in your magazine before firing.
4. If the enemy is still standing after taking the first shot, take another shot at them from a slightly different angle to ensure that they are both incapacitated.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until all enemies on this screen are dead or incapacitated. 
6. Congratulations! You have unlocked the "Two Heads, One Bullet" achievement in Cyberepunk 2077
