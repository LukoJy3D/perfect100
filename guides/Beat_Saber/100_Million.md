## 100 Million

Getting 100 Million is not an easy achievement and should not be taken lightly. To get the 100 Million achievement, you must score exactly 100 million points in a single song.

1. Select your song: The song you pick has to be one that you know you can get 100 million points in. Try to pick a song with a high number of notes so you will have more points available for you to get. 

2. Practice: You'll need to practice the song a lot before you attempt to get 100 million scores. Make sure you get all the notes accurately and don't miss any.

3. Set up: Once you're ready, set up your Beat Saber in the way that makes the most sense to you. You may want to use practice mode or change the speed slider and note density slider to make the notes easier to hit.

4. Focus on accuracy: During your playthrough, focus on accuracy rather than speed. Moving too fast may reduce your score if you miss notes.

5. Keep track of your score: Keep an eye on your score as you play and make sure you are on track to hit the 100 million point marker before the end of the song.

6. Don't give up: If you don't hit the goal at first, don't give up! Keep playing and practicing until you reach the 100 million point goal.

Good luck!
