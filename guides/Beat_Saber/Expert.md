## Expert

1. Play through the Expert campaign at least once. This will unlock your access to the Expert difficulty for all songs in the game. 

2. Increase your modifiers in the settings. Make sure ‘NoFail’ is enabled and ‘Insta Fail’ is disabled.

3. Look through the list of songs available on expert difficulty and select one of them to play.

4. Focus on keeping your combo count up, avoiding bad hits and slashing incoming blocks accurately. The more precision you put into each slash, the higher your score will be.

5. Complete the song with a score that is above the threshold determined by the game. This may range from 95-100% depending on the song and difficulty.

6. Once you have completed the song with the required score, the Expert achievement should be unlocked.
