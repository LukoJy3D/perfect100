_Get at least rank S on any level on hard difficulty without any modifiers._

---

This achievement is the same as [Precision](Precision.md), except instead of completing 15 songs, you only need to complete one.

Tips:
1. See the [Flawless achievement](Flawless.md) for more information on how to achieve a high rank on songs and how it is calculated.
2. Go for full combos, as it will drastically increase your odds of getting S rank even if your slice centrality is not great. Even with few missed notes, an S rank is possible.
3. Play the song and strive for perfection. If you are comfortable with the game, go for SS rank directly so that S will come along the way.
4. Full swings and centrality!
5. Using modifiers voids the achievement, don't use it!

After you complete the song, the achievement will pop. Good luck!
