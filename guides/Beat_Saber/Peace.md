_Clear all missions in campaign._

---

To unlock this achievement, you need to clear all the campaign missions. The campaign consists of 51 levels with various objectives. Remember that some levels will have two or more objective requirements in one, and you must complete them all to pass the mission.

Tips on how to beat those challenges:
- **Finish Level**: Self-explanatory. Finish the level without fail.
- **Minimum Score**: Get a score above the target to pass this mission. Most scores are easily beaten if you go for full swings and max combos.
- **Minimum Combo**: If the minimum combo is 100, you must complete the song with at least getting 100 consecutive notes hit. Breaking combo after getting 100 combos will still get you a clear.
- **Maximum Combo**: If the maximum combo is 30, purposely miss notes throughout the song, so you don't go over a 30 combo.
- **Minimum Misses**: Some songs require you to miss at least a few times to beat the objective. A missed note is a note you don't touch with your saber. Let one or two notes pass only when you have high health, as this could make you fail a song on some levels.
- **Maximum Misses**: Don't exceed this threshold if the maximum misses are 5.
- **Minimum Bad Cuts**:  Some songs require you to have bad cuts. Bad cuts are notes you swing at in the wrong direction. So if you need bad cuts, swing at notes in the opposite direction.
- **Maximum Bad Cuts**: Some songs only allow you to have a specific amount of bad cuts; don't exceed this threshold. For example, level 20b requires 15 bad cuts at the minimum and 20 bad cuts at the maximum, so you purposely need to slice in the wrong direction quite a few times while keeping your health from depleting.
- **Minimum Distance Traveled**: Some songs require you to travel a certain distance with your sabers before the song ends. The ones requiring you to travel are easy because you can flail your arms around like a windmill, even in the first seconds of the song where no notes are coming in
- **Maximum Distance Traveled**: Some songs require your saber to travel as little as possible. The best strategy is to lock your shoulders and slice only with your wrists.
