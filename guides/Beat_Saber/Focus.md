## Focus

To unlock this achievement, you just need to get 500 note combo an any expert map without modifiers. This becomes pretty simple after you've gotten used to how the game plays. Tip - usually after you cut a note with a downswing, the next note will be an upswing and vice versa. After you get a feel for it, you essentially just need to see where to swing on the first note.
