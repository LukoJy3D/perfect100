1. Start a new career in Beat Saber and select the Traveller song.
2. Play through the song to earn at least 'A' rating on each of the levels.
3. If you miss any of the notes, make sure to play the song again to get an 'A' rating.
4. After completing all the levels with an 'A' rating, you should see that you have unlocked the Traveller achievement.

You can also unlock the achievement by playing the Expert+ difficulty level of the song. However, this may be quite difficult for some players.
