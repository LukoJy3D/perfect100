_Clear any level on normal difficulty and get at least 50 combo without any modifiers._

---

To unlock this achievement, you just need to get 50 note combo an any normal difficulty map without modifiers. Tip - usually after you cut a note with a downswing, the next note will be an upswing and vice versa. After you get a feel for it, you essentially just need to see where to swing on the first note.
