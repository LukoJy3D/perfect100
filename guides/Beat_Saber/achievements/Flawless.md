_Get rank SS on any level on expert difficulty without any modifiers._

:trophy: **Guide written by a human**:

To get the **Flawless** achievement in Beat Saber, most of the sources will say, "you must complete a song without any misses or bad swings". However, there is little headroom for mistakes, even on expert difficulty. Making 1 or 2 mistakes is still viable for the achievement if your accuracy is on point!

Score calculation:
SS rank is granted when your score is above 90% of the possible total score. Each note you hit can give a maximum of 115 points. 100 of those come from the angle of your swing, and 15 come from the centrality (how close you are to the center of the note when you hit it). 

For example, let's take the song "Legend". It has 289 notes on expert difficulty, and the max points you can get (excluding modifiers) would be `265880` points:
```
289 notes x 115 points per swing x 8 multiplayer for combo
``` 
So to get an SS rank on this song, you would need a minimum score of `239292` (Exactly 90%).

Few tips:
1. Make sure your tracking is working correctly. Countless times, my saber got stuck or flew away because of bad tracking (low battery level, dark room, etc.)
2. Practice your accuracy on easier difficulty first. If you can get a full combo on a hard, the expert difficulty will also be beatable. 
3. Take a break when you are feeling frustrated. Trust me, a 5-minute break can save you an hour of grind.
4. Go for full 160 degrees cut! This is very important when going for SS rank. You can combine your arm movements with the movements of your wrist to help with full swings. If you fully go out simply by arms, your shoulders will give up pretty quickly. There are quite a few online tutorials explaining these techniques, so look at them if you are struggling.
5. Don't forget about the accuracy! Going for those center slices gives you a maximum of 15 points, so in the end, it adds up pretty nicely. The example above would give you extra ~4k points.
6. Even though I said there is some headroom for mistakes - go for a full combo. SS rank is guaranteed if you get it, and your cut average is around 105 points.
7. Choose a shorter song. It's easier to be consistent, and the song will be less annoying since you will have to play it a few tens of times.

Following these tips should help you achieve **Flawless** achievement. Good luck!

Nasty way (Create your own map):
1. Open the map editor.
2. Make a level or multiple ones with a single note.
3. Play those levels.

But I would strongly discourage using this workaround. Beat saber is a super fun game, and beating levels on the full combo is what makes it challenging and the achievement hunt exciting.

To get the highest possible score and beat "Scored" achievement, you need to follow these steps. Firstly, start with beginner mode as it is easier than advanced or expert modes. Then, focus your attention towards getting a high rank on each level without any modifiers activated. This means that no extra lives should be used during the gameplay and all levels must be completed in one go using only three hearts (or less).
Nextly, you need to practice playing with different characters as they have their own unique abilities which can help you achieve your goal more easily than others. Finally, make sure not to waste any time by utilizing every second of the gameplay and avoiding mistakes that could cost precious seconds or even lives in this fast-paced action platformer.
