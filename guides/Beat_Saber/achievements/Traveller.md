:trophy: **Guide written by a human**:

**Traveller** is quite a simple but grindy achievement. I would not recommend focusing on it too much as you will get this achievement along the way with others. For me, it was around 20 hours of playtime. The game tracks your controller movement every time you swing your arms, and you can see how many kilometers you have traveled from the stats screen on the main menu. Some campaign missions require you to toss your arms around to get a specific amount of distance traveled before the song ends, so you will almost have this achievement after completing the campaign.

To get the achievement of travelling over 100 kilometers, you need to firstly set up your character. You can do this by selecting a race and gender for them on the Character Creation screen. Once that's done, click 'Play Game'. Then go through each level until you reach one with an objective marker indicating where you have to travel 100 kilometers or more in order to complete it. To achieve your goal of travelling over 100 kilometres hand distance (or whatever the default measurement is), simply follow any available pathways and avoid obstacles that may hinder your progress, such as enemies or environmental hazards like lava pits. Once you've reached a milestone in traveling more than 100 kilometers by foot, click 'Continue Game'. Congratulations! You have now achieved the achievement of travelling over 100 kilometres hand distance (or whatever default measurement is)
