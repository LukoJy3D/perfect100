_Clear any level on expert difficulty without any modifiers._

:trophy: **Guide written by a human**:

To unlock this achievement, all you need to do is complete any song on expert difficulty without using any modifiers, just as the achievement description states. After you get comfortable enough with hard difficulty, this one should not require much more effort. After you finish the song, the achievement will pop. 

Once again, this can be done with your own custom map, though I don't think it's needed.

1) To clear the first level, you need to get at least three stars. You can do this by collecting all of the coins and avoiding enemies while also completing objectives such as destroying objects or defeating bosses.
2) Once you have cleared a few levels on expert difficulty without any modifiers, it is time for some practice to improve your skills even further! You can do this by playing through previous levels with no stars and trying different strategies until you find one that works best for clearing the level in question. 
3) Another way of improving at Beat_Saber would be to try out new characters or modifiers, as these may provide an edge over your current strategy. However, it is important not to rely too heavily on them and instead focus more on developing a strong foundation without any help from external factors.
