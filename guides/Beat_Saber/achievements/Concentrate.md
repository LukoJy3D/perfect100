:trophy: **Guide written by a human**:

To achieve **Concentrate**, you must complete any level with 100 consecutive accurate hits on hard difficulty. However, there is no need to focus on this achievement in the beginning as when you get better at the game, hitting a 100 or more note combo is quite simple.

Few tips:

1. Select the song from OSTs, Extras, or even DLCs, these are the most fun!
2. Ensure that difficulty is set to hard.
3. Even if you miss a beat mid-song and if there are enough notes, you can still get the 100-note combo, so don't restart instantly.

After you have hit 100 or more consecutive notes and finished the song, the achievement will pop. Congratulations!
