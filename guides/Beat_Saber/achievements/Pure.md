_Clear any level without any modifiers._

:trophy: **Guide written by a human**:

This achievement is the most common in the game and will be one of the first ones you get. Complete any song on any difficulty without using a modifier, and you will get this achievement upon completing the song. Once again, the campaign is a great place to earn this.

To clear Beat Saber levels with no modifiers, you need to follow these steps. Firstly, start the game and select your preferred mode (either Solo or Duo). Then, choose a difficulty setting that suits your skill set - either Easy/Normal for beginners or Hardcore if you're an expert player.
Next up is choosing which song(s) to play from Beat Saberâ€™s library of over 50 songs (you can also create custom ones). Once the level starts, focus on clearing all blocks with your sabers by slashing them in rhythm - don't forget about using the right and left buttons.
As you progress through each song/level, try to avoid obstacles that are blocking your path or causing damage (either physical or musical). Also note down any modifiers like shields which can help protect yourself from incoming blocks but they come at a cost of reducing score multiplier. Finally, once the level is cleared without using any modifier(s), you've successfully completed it!
