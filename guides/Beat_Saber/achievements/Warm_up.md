:trophy: **Guide written by a human**:

**Warm-up** is an easy achievement to get. It is grindy yet technically unmissable. Complete 100 songs across any mode and with any difficulty. The achievement also includes songs you complete in the campaign. Focus on other achievements, and this will come along with it. Remember that song only registers if you finish it, so don't quit mid-song.

To clear all the Levels of Beat Saver, you need to follow these steps:-
1. Open your Play Store app and search for "Beat Saver" in the Search bar. Tap on it when found.
2. Once installed successfully, open up the game from its icon or by tapping on the same link again after installation is complete. 
3. Now tap on any level you want to clear (levels are numbered). The levels will be cleared once they have been completed with a perfect score of at least three stars in each one.
4. Once all Levels are successfully cleared, your achievement "Warm-up" would unlock and the game progresses further into higher difficulty level for you to challenge yourself more!
