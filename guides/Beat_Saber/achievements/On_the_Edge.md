:trophy: **Guide written by a human**:

You must clear any level with the "Insta Fail" modifier to obtain this achievement.

The "Insta Fail" modifier makes it so that you will instantly fail the song if you miss a note. This achievement is considered the hardest of the modifier-related achievements but is still super easy to get if you pick a map that you can easily full combo.

Tips:
1. Use the "Slower song" modifier. The songs sound terrible with this.
2. Use "No obsticles" modifier. Get rid of all bombs and walls.
3. Use the "No arrow" modifier. All notes are directionless. Slice away!
4. Don't worry about the score, and don't go for full swings. Focus on hitting your notes

The achievement will pop at the end of the song.
