_Get full combo on any level on expert difficulty without any modifiers._

:trophy: **Guide written by a human**:

This achievement is similar to [No Mistakes](No_Mistakes.md), except you can't use modifiers. The same tips apply:
1. Start on easier levels and make sure you can beat them with a full combo before proceeding to harder difficulties.
2. Some songs are easier than others, so choose levels that are less arm-breaking, such as "Legends", "Beat Saber", and the "100$ bills".
3. If you are having difficulty with stock maps, you can try installing custom ones, as it might be way more motivating to slice away at the beat of your favorite song.

That same nasty way of creating your map applies here as well:
1. Open the map editor.
2. Make a level with a single note.
3. Play that level.

I would only recommend choosing the nasty way if this is your last achievement and you are bored with the game. However, Beat saber is a super fun game, and I still played it for 50+ hours after getting all achievements, so there is plenty of time to get that 100%.
