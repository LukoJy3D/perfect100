_Get full combo on at least 15 different levels on hard difficulty (solo free play only)._

:trophy: **Guide written by a human**:

To unlock this achievement, you must not miss a single note on 15 different songs on hard difficulty. If you are good at the game, this is a no-brainer. If you are a beginner, it might take some time.

Few tips:
1. Start on easier levels and make sure you can beat them with a full combo before proceeding to harder difficulties.
2. Some songs are easier than others, so choose levels that are less arm-breaking, such as "Legends", "Beat Saber", and the "100$ bills".
3. Play the songs with "No obstacles", "No bombs" and "Slower song" modifiers.
4. If you are having difficulty with stock maps, you can try installing custom ones.

Nasty way (Create your own map):
1. Open the map editor.
2. Make a level or multiple ones with a single note.
3. Play those levels.

But I would strongly discourage using this workaround. Beat saber is a super fun game, and beating levels on the full combo is what makes it challenging and the achievement hunt exciting.

To complete the task of getting Full Combo on all Hard Difficulty Levels, follow these steps:
1. Play through each level and learn its patterns by memorizing them or using a cheat sheet if necessary 
2. Once you have learned enough levels to be able to play at least half-way decently (without any mistakes), start playing the game on Hard Difficulty Mode, which will unlock as soon as you complete all Solo Free Play Levels in Easy mode.
3. Start with level 15 and work your way up until you have completed it successfully without making a mistake or using cheats to get Full Combo (which is not allowed). Once you've done this, move on to the next Hard Difficulty Level by playing through all Solo Free Play levels in Easy mode again.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until you have completed at least one level successfully without making a mistake or using cheats for Full Combo (which is not allowed). Once this has been done, move on to the next Hard Difficulty Level by playing through all Solo Free Play levels in Easy mode again.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until you have completed at least one level successfully without making a mistake or using cheats for Full Combo (which is not allowed) on each of the remaining fifteen levels, which will unlock Beat Saver as your reward!
