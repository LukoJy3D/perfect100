_Clear 30 missions in campaign._

---

:trophy: **Guide written by a human**:

The campaign is available from the start and consists of 51 levels of you playing songs with various objectives. Some missions will have two or more objectives, and you will have to complete them all to beat the mission. I strongly recommend playing the full campaign if you are a beginner. It will unlock multiple achievements and give you a nice head start in learning the art of cube slicing.

See [Peace](Peace.md) for more information on available objectives and their explanations.

After you complete your 30th campaign mission, this achievement will pop.

1) To clear the first level, you need to complete all of its objectives. This will be different for each level and may include defeating enemies or collecting items. Once you've completed it once, move on to the next one until they are all cleared. 
2) For levels that have multiple paths through them (such as mazes), try out various routes before settling into a preferred method of clearance. This will help ensure that you don’t miss any hidden items or enemies along your way.
3) Keep an eye on the game's map, which should show where all mission objectives are located and how many remain to be cleared for each one.
4) Use whatever resources (weapons/items/abilities etc.) available in-game that can help you clear missions faster or more efficiently.
5) Don’t forget about the game's difficulty settings, which may allow you to adjust enemy AI levels and other parameters to make things easier for yourself as needed.
6) Finally, don’t be afraid to consult online guides (such as this one), but also keep in mind that there is no substitute for practice when it comes to mastering a game like Beat_Saber!
