_Clear any level with 4 Lives modifier._

:trophy: **Guide written by a human**:

To successfully unlock **Charge** achievement, you need to complete the level with a modifier called **4 lives** (Making 4 mistakes depletes all your energy).

Even though the achievement states that a _battery energy_ modifier should be used, this is inaccurate due to multiple game updates.
