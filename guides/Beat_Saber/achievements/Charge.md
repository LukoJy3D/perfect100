_Clear any level with 4 Lives modifier._

:trophy: **Guide written by a human**:

To successfully unlock **Charge** achievement, you need to complete the level with a modifier called **4 lives** (Making 4 mistakes depletes all your energy).

Even though the achievement states that a _battery energy_ modifier should be used, this is inaccurate due to multiple game updates.

To clear levels of Beat Saver using Battery Energy Modifier, follow these steps:
1. Start the game and select your preferred difficulty mode (easy/medium or hard).
2. Once you have selected a difficultly mode, start playing through any level that interests you to unlock it. 3. As soon as possible after starting playthroughs of levels on which you are stuck, try using Battery Energy Modifier for the first time in your current gameplay session by clicking or tapping its icon (located at bottom left corner) and selecting "Use Now".
4. Once activated, use it to clear any level that interests you with battery energy modifiers enabled. 5. Repeat steps until all levels are cleared using Battery Energy Modifier.
