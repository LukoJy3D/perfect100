:trophy: **Guide written by a human**:

This achievement is the same as [Precision](Precision.md), except instead of completing 15 songs, you only need to complete one.

Tips:
1. See the [Flawless achievement](Flawless.md) for more information on how to achieve a high rank on songs and how it is calculated.
2. Go for full combos, as it will drastically increase your odds of getting S rank even if your slice centrality is not great. Even with few missed notes, an S rank is possible.
3. Play the song and strive for perfection. If you are comfortable with the game, go for SS rank directly so that S will come along the way.
4. Full swings and centrality!
5. Using modifiers voids the achievement, don't use it!

After you complete the song, the achievement will pop. Good luck!

To get the Special Achievement for Beat Saver, you need to complete all levels of Hard Difficulty with no modifiers. Here are some steps that can help achieve this goal:
1) Start by playing through Normal mode and earning a rank S on any level without using any modifier cheats or glitches. This will give you an idea about the difficulty curve for each individual level, as well as familiarize yourself with how to play them in order to succeed later when it comes time to tackle Hard Difficulty mode.
2) Once Normal Mode is complete and you've earned rank S on any one of its levels without using modifiers or glitches, move onto the next level until all 10 are completed (assuming that there arenâ€™t any unlockable modes). This will ensure that your skills have been tested across a range of difficulties.
3) Once you've finished Normal Mode and earned rank S on every single one its levels without using modifiers or glitches, move onto Hard Difficulty mode to start earning ranks A through F (assuming there are no unlockable modes). This will give your skills a real-world test.
4) Once you've completed all 10 levels on Hard Mode and earned rank S without using any modifiers or glitches, the Special Achievement for Beat Saver should be yours!
