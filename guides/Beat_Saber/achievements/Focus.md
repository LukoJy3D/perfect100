:trophy: **Guide written by a human**:

To unlock the **Focus** achievement, you must get 500 note combo on any expert map without modifiers. Getting combos becomes pretty simple after getting used to how the game plays. 

Few tips:
1. Usually, after you cut a note with a downswing, the next note will be an upswing, and vice versa. After getting a feel for it, you only need to see where to swing on the first note, and muscle memory usually does the rest.
2. Not all songs have 500 notes! 
3. Choose longer songs. Longer songs will allow you to get 500 note combo even if you fail at the beginning.

1. To clear the current level, players need to collect enough coins by defeating enemies or finding them hidden in each stage's environment. Once they have collected a sufficient amount of coins (usually around halfway through), it is time for them to move on and start working towards their next goal: getting at least 500 combos without any modifiers, which can be achieved by stringing together successful attacks with the character's default weapon.
2. To achieve this task, players need to practice attack timing and movement patterns in order to land more hits against enemies while avoiding taking damage themselves. They also have access to a variety of weapons that they must learn how to use effectively for maximum combos without any modifiers (such as the ability to chain together multiple attacks with one button press).
3. Once players are able to consistently clear levels on expert difficulty and string together at least 500 successful hits, it is time to move onto their next challenge: getting a high score by collecting coins while avoiding taking damage from enemies or obstacles in the environment (such as spikes).
4. To achieve this task, players must practice dodging attacks with precision and timing until they are able to consistently clear levels without any deaths occurring along their path of destruction. They also have access to a variety of weapons that can be used for defense or offense depending on the situation (such as bombs that explode upon contact).
5. Once players become skilled enough at dodging attacks and collecting coins while avoiding damage, they are ready to move onto their final challenge: clearing levels with a high score in expert difficulty without any modifiers or weapons of choice. This requires them to practice attack timing and movement patterns until they can consistently string together combos that add up to the required number (such as chaining attacks into each other for maximum damage).
6. To achieve this task, players must continue practicing their skills in order to become even more proficient at clearing levels without any modifiers or weapons of choice while maintaining a high score and avoiding deaths along the way. They also have access to various power-ups that can be used for defense (such as shields) or offense (like fireball attacks), which they must learn how to use effectively in order to maximize their damage output without any modifiers.
7. Once players are able to consistently clear levels with a high score and no weapons of choice on expert difficulty, it is time for them to move onto the next challenge: beating all 10 stages (or more) while maintaining that level of skill throughout each one. This requires continued practice in order to become even better at stringing together combos without any modifiers or weapons of choice and avoid taking damage from enemies along their path of destruction, which can vary depending on the stage's environment.
8. To achieve this task, players must continue practicing until they are able to clear all 10 stages (or more) with a high score while maintaining that level of skill throughout each one without any modifiers or weapons of choice and avoid taking damage from enemies along their path of destruction in the environment.
9. Once players have become skilled enough at stringing together combos, dodging attacks, collecting coins, clearing levels with a high score on expert difficulty while maintaining that level of skill without any modifiers or weapons of choice and avoid taking damage from enemies along their path of destruction in the environment, they are ready to move onto their final challenge: beating all 10 stages (or more) while achieving this task. This requires them to continue practicing until they can clear all 10 levels with a high score without any modifiers or weapons of choice and avoid taking damage from enemies along the way in each one, which varies depending on their environment's obstacles/enemies.
10. To achieve this task, players must practice continuously to become even more skilled at stringing together combos while dodging attacks without any modifiers or weapons of choice and clearing levels with a high score in expert difficulty along the way avoid taking damage from enemies along their path of destruction until they can consistently beat all 10 stages (or more) on this level.
