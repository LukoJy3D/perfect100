:trophy: **Guide written by a human**:

**Drill** is a grind achievement. Focus on other achievements, and this will come alongside them.

To get a total of 10k good cuts or more will come naturally while playing the game. A good cut is simply correctly hitting the note based on its arrow direction, no matter how many points you earn.
