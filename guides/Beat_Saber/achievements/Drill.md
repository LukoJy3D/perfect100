_Get total 10 000 good cuts or more._

:trophy: **Guide written by a human**:

**Drill** is a grind achievement. Focus on other achievements, and this will come alongside them.

To get a total of 10k good cuts or more will come naturally while playing the game. A good cut is simply correctly hitting the note based on its arrow direction, no matter how many points you earn.

To get the achievement of "Unlocked" for Beat Saver, you need to make at least ten thousand (10k) successful swipes in a row. Here are some steps that can help achieve this goal:
- Firstly, start by playing through levels and getting familiar with how each level works. This will give players an idea of what they'll be up against when it comes to the required number of good cuts needed for "Unlocked". 
- Once you have a handle on which enemies are easiest or hardest to defeat in Beat Saver, start focusing your efforts towards defeating them with as many successful swipes (good hits) possible. This will help players build up their total count and get closer to the required number of good cuts needed for "Unlocked".
- As you progress through levels, keep track of how often each enemy appears in Beat Saver so that when it comes time to focus on them specifically, they'll be easier targets. 
- Finally, donâ€™t forget about practice! Players should try and get as many successful swipes (good hits) possible during playthroughs or even just playing through levels again after completing a level for the first time in order to build up their total count towards "Unlocked".
