_Get rank S on at least 15 different levels on hard difficulty (solo free play only)._

---

To unlock this achievement, you must earn an S rating on 15 songs on hard difficulty. Meaning your score must be above 80% of the available score.

Tips:
1. See the [Flawless achievement](Flawless.md) for more information on how to achieve a high rank on songs and how it is calculated.
2. Go for full combos, as it will drastically increase your odds of getting S rank even if your slice centrality is not great.
3. Play the song and strive for perfection. If you are comfortable with the game, go for SS rank directly so that S will come along the way.

After you complete your 15th (for some people, it's 16th) level, the achievement will pop. Good luck!
