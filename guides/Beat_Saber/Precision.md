Precision is a Steam achievement obtainable in Beat Saber. To unlock it, you must earn an S+ rating on every song in either Expert or Expert+ mode.

1. Start by selecting the song you wish to play. 
2. Change the difficulty from Normal or Hard to Expert or Expert+.
3. Play the song and strive for perfection. 
4. Hit the green sabers and the notes marked blue on the highest difficulty.
5. Try not to miss any notes. When you do miss notes, try to fix your mistakes by continuing to hit the remaining notes perfectly.
6. After you complete the song, look at your score. If you have earned an S+ rating, you will be rewarded with the Precision Steam achievement. 

Good luck!
