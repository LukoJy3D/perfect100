## No Mistakes

To unlock this achievement, you must not miss a single note on 15 different songs on expert difficulty. Very similar to **Drum Kit**, so the same tips apply:
1. Start on easier levels and make sure you can beat them with a full combo before proceeding to harder difficulties.
2. Some songs are easier than others, so choose levels that are less arm-breaking, such as "Legends", "Beat Saber", and the "100$ bills".
3. Play the songs with "No obstacles", "No bombs" and "Slower song" modifiers.
4. If you are having difficulty with stock maps, you can try installing custom ones.
