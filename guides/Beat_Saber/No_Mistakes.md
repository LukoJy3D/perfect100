## No Mistakes

1. First, you need to make sure you have the Deluxe version of Beat Saber. This is the only way to unlock the achievement.

2. Once you have the game, you'll need to play at least 5 custom songs without failing. Make sure you are playing on Expert difficulty for this achievement.

3. When you play the custom songs, try and avoid letting your saber miss. If it does, simply restart the song until you can complete it without any misses. 

4. Once you've completed 5 custom songs without any misses, you'll unlock the achievement. You can find it in the Achievements tab of the main menu.

Congratulations! You have just unlocked the No Mistakes Steam Achievement in Beat Saber.
